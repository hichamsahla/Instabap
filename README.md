# Instabap


Project Background:

The goal of the project was to build a website ,
where you could upload a photo in a database and show it on the home page.
You had to achieve this by using php
experience:

This was the first time that I had to work with php.
I found it hard to find out how to connect with the database and insert pictures.
Displaying the picture on
the home page went a lot easier ,than uploading the picture
